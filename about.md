Hey there! My name is Dennis Decoene, and I'm a full-stack web developer who also posts stuff on the internet. I live in Menin, Belgium, and work as a freelance webdeveloper.

This website is a place to share my thoughts, ideas, projects and findings. It's built with the excellent [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and the theme is based on the equally great [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/).

The site is hosted on [Github](https://github.com), and the source code can be found [there](https://github.com/AvidSoftware-be/AvidSoftware-be.github.io) too.

In addition to this website, you can find me a couple of other places around the internet:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/AvidSoftware-be)
* [LinkedIn](https://be.linkedin.com/in/dennisdecoene)
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/181013/dennis-decoene)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DDecoene)

Thanks for reading!
